Three people were killed and six injured on Monday after a fuel tanker exploded at a Russian airfield near the city of Ryazan, southeast of Moscow, the RIA Novosti news agency reported.

In alleged footage of the explosion, two large fireballs can be seen from a distance illuminating the night sky.

No further details have emerged so far, though it follows a series of suspected attacks inside Russia thought to have been carried out by Ukraine.

Last week a huge fire ripped through an oil depot in Russia's Bryansk region near the border with Ukraine  following a suspected drone attack. The governor did not say what caused the fire, but the pro-Kremlin Izvestia newspaper reported it was caused by an unidentified munition dropped from a drone. 

Ukraine has not claimed responsibility for the explosion at Ryazan.
